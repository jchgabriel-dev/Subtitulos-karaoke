Fly Me to the Moon let me play Among the Stars
let me see what spring is like on a Jupiter and
another
hold my hand
-
baby kiss me
fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore
you are all I long for all I worship and adore
-
please be true
I love you
-
-
fill my heart with song let me sing forevermore
you are all I long for all I
